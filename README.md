## Using the website
* Using the webite is pretty easy, all you need to do is scroll along the length of the device. Discovering new images all the way through.
* If you are searching for a particular topic, then go to the search bar that is located on the top of the webpage right underneath the navbar of the page.
* Search your query in the search box and the respective results will be displayed on the screen. That too with the benifit of never endng images.
* The images will never end to appear on the screen, the website is created so as the input of images will never end but optimized so that it does not cost you much data in viewing the images.
